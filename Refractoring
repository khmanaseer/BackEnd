==============1st Step===============
//creating  routes directory with the associated routes in it
//verifiy router so we can exports it
const express = require("express")
const router  = express.Router()

//all Models have to be called ad make attention to the new directory 
const Gallery = require("../models/gallery")

//all app Routes have to be replaced by router instead
module.exports = router //at the end of the file


==============2nd Step===============
//they have to be required in app.js file using
const galleryRoutes = require(./routes)
//then it has to be used in the app for each router
app.use(galleryRoutes)

==============3rd Step===============
//isLoggedIn has to be identified also in all these routes
function isLoggedIn(req, res, next){
    if(req.isAuthenticated()){
        return next();
    }
    res.redirect("/login");
}

==============4th Step===============
since index file has authntication Router, passport has to be identified with User
const passport = require("passport")
const User	   = require('../models/user')

==============5th Step===============
currentUser has to be called in each router in order for the Navbar to work
router.use(function(req, res, next){
   res.locals.currentUser = req.user;
   next();
});

==============last Step===============
//The most important thing is having all the above identified after pssport configuration
